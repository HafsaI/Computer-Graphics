# Homework 1 - Foundations
# CS 440 Computer Graphics, Fall 2021

---

# Purpose

Our eventual display medium is an image which comprises of pixels, each represented by a color value. Color can be represented using various schemes. We also like to render pretty pictures, especially if they have elegant mathematical descriptions. 

Line and polygon drawing are fundamental operations and are the natural next step after pixel manipulation. We will explore how discrete elements like lines and polygons are used to represent seemingly smooth objects, e.g. a circle. 

# Background

For this assignment, you should
- understand the composition of an image
- know the RGBA and CMYK color schemes
- be able to perform arithmetic
- be able to perform arithmetic and vector operations
- have an appreciation for the application of math 
- be familiar with operations on complex numbers
- be able to think algorithmically
- have an appreciation of programming as a tool to efficiently carry out interesting mathematical operations at scale
- be comfortable with reading and writing code in python
- be comfortable with reading, writing, testing, and debugging code in python, especially involving recursion

# The Problem Set

The problems are in `hw1.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Submission

There are 3 parts to this assignment.

## 1.1 Solving the Problem Set

Each problem in the problem set specifies the name of the function to write for it. Please make sure that your submitted functions have the indicated names. The required file names are also specified. Files with those names in your GitHub repository at the time of the deadline will be considered your team's submission. As your submission will be graded by your peers, please do not include identifying information in it.

This is a team submission on GitHub and contributes to your _Submission Score_.

Deadline: 2359h on Tuesday, 28 September

## 1.2 Feedback

You will provide feedback on your teammate and on the assignment. The related assignment will be available on LMS with further instructions and will be due at the same time as the problem set.
