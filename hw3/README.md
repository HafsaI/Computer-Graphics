# Homework 3: Ray Tracing Engine
# CS 440 Computer Graphics, Fall 2021
***

# Purpose

This homework sets the foundation of an extendable ray tracing engine using principles of Object Oriented design. It implements some of the ray tracing topics we have covered, namely:

- tracing a ray through a scene
- sampling a scene
- perspective and parallel projection
- ray-primitive intersections

# Background

For this homework, you must know

- how to read and write object oriented code in C++
- how to compile a C++ project spanning multiple files in multiple directories
- vector arithmetic

# The Problem Set

The problems are defined in `hw3.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Time Requirement

Previous teams that worked on this homework reported the following number of hours for their attempt.
- (min, max) : (18, 75)
- (mean, median, stdev) : (41, 35, 19.0)

# Last year's feedback

A summary of the feedback on this assignment from last year is included in `feedback.md`. Some flattering comments toward the bottom of the file are included in their entirety! Based on the feedback, some function signatures have been updated. Please ask Ali to explain the class hierarchy in the recitation session.

# Submission

There are 3 parts to the submission. Failure to turn in any of them will result in a withholding of marks for the homework.

## 3.1 Problem Set

Submit _all_ code files in the `raytracer` folder and its relevant subfolders. `World.cpp` should include an implementation of `World::build` corresponding to your desired scene. Compiling and running `raytracer.cpp` in the `raytracer` folder should generate the corresponding image as `scene.ppm`. You may include other `World::build` implementations in the `build` folder. 

Any files in your GitHub repository with these names at the time of the deadline will be considered as your submission. Your submissions will be peer reviewed so please do not include identifying information. Your code will be run by a peer on their machine _as is_ so make sure not to include non-portable files. Include any special compilation instructions at the bottom of this file for the benefit of your peer reviewer.

This is a team submission on GitHub and contributes to your _Submission Score_.

_Deadline_: 2359h on Sunday, 28 November

## 3.2 Feedback Form

You will provide feedback on your buddies and on the homework. The feedback form will be available on LMS with further instructions and will be due at the same time as the problem set.

This is an individual submission on LMS and contributes to your individual _Team Factor_ which is 1 by default and penalized for non-submission or non-participation in the team as assessed through peer feedback or GitHub contribution.

_Deadline_: 2359h on Sunday, 28 November

## 3.3 Peer Review

You will review and grade 2 submissions which will be shared with you through an assignment on LMS. The assignment will become available on LMS with further instructions after the submission of the first 2 parts.

This is an individual submission on LMS and contributes to your individual _Review Factor_ which is 1 by default and penalized for non-submission.

Deadline: 2359h on Tuesday, 30 November

# Grading

Your submission will be graded as per the criteria specified in the accompanying file, _hw3-review.xlsx_. This will contribute to your _Submission Score_.

Your individual score in this homework is the product of your Submission Score, Team Factor, and Review Factor.

# Tips

- Do not include identifying information in your submission.
- There is no late submission. Submit whatever you have by the deadline.
- viel Spa√ü!

# Discussion

This is a challenging assignment. Start early and do lots of discussion through the following avenues:

- discuss with your buddies,
- the corresponding discussion thread on LMS,
- discuss with your peers,
- consult with course staff.

# Compile Instructions

_<Replace this with any special compile instructions for your peer reviewer. It is important that your code compiles. Non-compiling code cannot be reviewed.>_
