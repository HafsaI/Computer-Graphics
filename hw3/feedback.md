# Last year's feedback on this homework

Learned
--

- Implementation of ray tracer from the ground up.
- using C++ and different libraries available in C++
- C++ and OOP concepts
- Integrating Computer Graphics concepts with object oriented techniques
- Brushed up C++ coding
- MATH was not that hard
- it was mostly in the Book or done in classes
- the theory and math behind ray tracing
- I actually learnt how to think in terms of graphics.
- I refreshed OOP methodologies and C++ syntax.
- applied the theory I learned in the Class related to the Raytracing.
- debugging. 
- working with a lot of dependent files.
- Implementing different shapes and projections in cpp.x
- ray tracing from below the ground up
- Not to be sloppy
- lot of things but I enjoyed learning specifically how to compute shade Info of a ray. Things make much more sense when we implement them.

Improve
--

- Some functions lacked some instructions while others were mechanical to implement as all the required info was provided.
- I think this can be improved by telling the context where the function will be used instead of telling what the function must do.
- Brief the students, there were a lot of elements which i didn't know about like samplers and google didnt help a lot initially.
- function names (e.g. min and max in Point3D doesn't make sense in its context)
- Giving more freedom to develop files as however we feel necessary would've been good
- I feel like, in the previous assignments/project, the questions led us to a final product step by step but this homework was really a problem to figure out what needs to be done. I couldn't even compile properly. There were so many errors.
- Maybe by not providing strict headers and giving the option to explore the book as well as other resources.
- More clarification on the different components, on custom functions in header
- More information regarding samplers would've been appreciated

- Was too big of a task for 5% of the grade.
- This was not a 90 minute homework! :p
- This homework gave me a headache.
- The assignment should have partial grade based on the implementation on some classes, so that if due to some errors the ray tracer is not working, and those errors can be debugged within a few hours time frame, then the submission should not get zero.
- Else, this assignment was the best one. Best already. its good as it is. Sounds in good shape for me, not much to say for improvement. The homework was perfect. Nicely architectured boilerplate. I thought I was looking at some code from the industry. This was the most fun part of the course. The assignment was almost perfect, I loved it. Thank you so much for putting in the efforts to design this assignment.
- I think that it is about coding the MATH we learn in classes of ray tracing and most of the code is also made available by Author. So what matters in this assignment, for me, is grasping the concepts of MATH so that they may be optimized.
Best assignment ever!
